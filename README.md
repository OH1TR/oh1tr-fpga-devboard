This is general purpose FPGA+ARM development board. My goal is to use it as software defined radio building block. But this board is designed to be general purpose, so it can be used for almost anything. It contains poweful Atmel SAM3U ARM processor with integrated high speed USB with 480Mbit/s transfer speed. FPGA on board is Spartan 6 XC6SLX9. This is one of the biggest FPGA chips available with TQFP package. It contains 16 DSP48A1 slices and also 2 CMT blocks (integrated PLL). Board has 55 general purpose IO pins from FPGA and 7 IO pins from SAM. Board can be assembled at home, but board manufacturer house for board making is recommented. Board also contains MMC card slot, FLASH chip for FPGA configuration data and few oscillators for frequency generation.
